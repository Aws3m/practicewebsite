                    My name is Sem Radoes. In 2013 I befriended people who work in IT. 
                    I was involved in their hobby projects and a wide world opened before my eyes.
                    My education at that moment prevented me from studying ICT. 
                    Throughout my career as pedagogue, i realised this is not a job that would make me happy.
                    It wasn't inline with my interests. When the opportunity arose, I started a bachelors degree. 
                    Soon i realised that an overall ICT degree wasn't what i was interested in.
                    I wanted to be a developer for web apps and websites. I was interested the most in the front end. 
                    So i enrolled in a front end developer course and now i am an enthousiastic front end developer who works as a freelancer.
