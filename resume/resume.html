            My name is Sem Radoes. In 2013 I befriended people who work in IT. 
            I was involved in their hobby projects and a wide world opened before my eyes.
            My education at that moment prevented me from studying ICT. 
            Throughout my career as pedagogue, i realised this is not a job that would make me happy.
            It wasn't inline with my interests. When the opportunity arose, I started a bachelors degree. 
            Soon i realised that an overall ICT degree wasn't what i was interested in.
            I wanted to be a developer for web apps and websites. I was interested the most in the front end. 
            So i enrolled in a front end developer course and now i am an enthousiastic front end developer who works for <mark>company name here</mark>
